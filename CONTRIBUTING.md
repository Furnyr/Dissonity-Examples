# Contributing

Thank you for showing interest in the project! Here is how you can contribute to the examples:

## Repository Examples

Examples whose purpose is to show how to use Dissonity APIs with other services can be added to this repository directly (e.g., showcasing how a backend in x language would integrate with Dissonity).

You may open an issue to discuss how to implement the example, or open a pull request directly if you are sure how to do it.

## External Examples

Examples whose purpose is to show third-party implementations of Dissonity should be linked in the [External Examples](README.md#external-examples) section of the main README.md to facilitate future maintenance (e.g., showcasing how a framework implements Dissonity).
